## Introduction

This project aims to implement a robust, compliant logging framework that can be integrated into systems requiring cybersecurity measures under DO-178B guidelines. It emphasizes:
- Secure communication for log transfers.
- Access control for authorized log access.
- Compliance traceability and adherence to the DO-178B safety standard.

## DO-178B Compliance

The DO-178B standard outlines guidelines for the development of software for airborne systems and equipment. This logging system project ensures compliance through:
- Requirements traceability: Documentation for each function’s role and requirement.
- Safety-critical design: Use of safe coding practices, defensive programming, and thorough testing.
- Verification and validation: Unit and integration testing for all critical components.
- Compliance documentation: Evidence collection for audits, reviews, and certification.
